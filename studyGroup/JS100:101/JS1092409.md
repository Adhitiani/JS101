General notes, not formatted ðŸ¤ .
â€‹
Idea to have alarms. 
â€‹
Force yourself to move on. Need to focus on answering a question. 
â€‹
Need to focus on talking about snippet. theoretical. 
â€‹
Methodically review all the study guide topics. Be able to explain. Need to be able to give examples to the fly.
â€‹
Dont expect one to one mapping with study guide. Expect combinations of specific topics of interests. 
â€‹
Not all questions will be code snippets. There are theoretical questions. There are questions that are NOT code.
â€‹
Pre writing stuff. Intialize, etc. How to get this?? Copy and paste minor templates. 
â€‹
Question: 
- Precise terminology. Character to char. Initialization to init. Declare to decl.
	- Think about use of grammarly, see if how this works
	- Dont go too much in the route of contracting words.

#### Interview Assessment
Use PEDAC. 
â€‹
Can only ask certain types of questions. Only to explain certain types of problem. To have clarity with boundaries of the problem.
â€‹
Medium level problem in 20 mins. See JS101 Small Problems. 
â€‹
Talk throughout the problem. Communicate that the person is in control of the problem solving. 
â€‹
Expected to only code within coderpad!! No syntax highlighting. 
â€‹
Two problems. Given test cases. Can add new test cases if some edges are missing. Code wont be run against the provided cases + common sense edge cases. Given common sense edge cases.
â€‹
There may be cases where the explicit conditions are states and there are no complimentary edge cases to have them.

Written Assessment: 
Question1:
```jsx
let animal = "dog"
â€‹
const speak = animal => {
  if (animal === undefined) {
    console.log("Bark")
  } else {
    console.log("Meow")
  }
}
â€‹
speak();
```
++ Variable shadowing
++ Undefined in arguments not being used. Default parameter value. Explicit and given a value, implicit if not given a value.
++ Function expression is arrow function
++ Not a silent error. Even
â€‹
Question2:
```jsx
let greeting = "Hello";
â€‹
const test = str => {
  str = str.concat(" World!");
  return str;
}
â€‹
test(greeting);
console.log(greeting);
```
++ Reassignment
++ **Passed by value** -- whatever is passed in the function, it does not affect the outside. 
++ See what str is returned. 
â€‹
Question 3: 
```jsx
let greeting = ["Hello"];
â€‹
const test = arr => {
  arr = arr.concat("World!");
  return arr;
}
â€‹
test(greeting);
console.log(greeting);
```
++ **Pass-by-reference** + Variable-as-pointer
++ Refrences to a new object, non-destructive method. Returns a new array object and is reassigned to the local variable `arr`.
++ do not use evaluate as this is in reference to an expression. when calling a method, say that this returns a new array object. 
++ This new object is then passed/returned
++ console.log logs the new 
â€‹
Question 4: 
```jsx
let greeting = ["Hello"];
â€‹
const test = arr => {
  arr = arr.push("World!");
  return arr;
}
â€‹
console.log(test(greeting));
console.log(greeting);
```
++ Pass-by-reference at pass on argument, pass-by-value at return
++ push returns the length of the new array. NOT an element. 
++ 
â€‹
```jsx
function test(str) {
  str + "!!!";
}
â€‹
let word = test("Hello");
â€‹
if (word) {
  console.log("Hi");
} else {
  console.log("Goodbye");
}
```
++ pass-by-value
++ implicit return value because there is no return statement -- undefined
